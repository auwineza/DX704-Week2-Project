I used ChatGPT (OpenAI) as a generative AI assistant to clarify assignment instructions, help debug Python code, and interpret results. All code was reviewed and executed by me.

No other outside sources or individuals were consulted.

Libraries used:
- pandas: data loading/manipulation and writing TSV outputs
- numpy: numeric calculations
